# Hero Installation

If your ReadyTheme did not come with the default Hero extension pre-installed, you can add it to your site by performing the following steps.

### Add the CSS
- Create a new build subdirectory as `build/extensions/hero/`
- Add [_hero.scss](_hero.scss) to the directory.
- Update your `build/extensions/extensions.scss` file to include `@import "hero/hero";`
