# Display List Filtering Installation

If your ReadyTheme did not come with the default Display List Filtering extension pre-installed, you can add it to your site by performing the following steps.

### Add the CSS
- Create a new build subdirectory as `build/extensions/display-list-filtering/`
- Add [_display-list-filtering.scss](_display-list-filtering.scss) to the directory.
- Update your `build/extensions/extensions.scss` file to include `@import "display-list-filtering/display-list-filtering";`
