This extension is the default payment card layout for the saved payment methods in Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS in `build/extensions/payment/` and update as part of your build process.
