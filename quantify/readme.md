The Quantify extension, included in Shadows, allows for the use of buttons to increase/decrease item quantities on the product and basket pages. We have added `data-` attributes to the `input` fields to accommodate the use of the [Quantity Limits](https://apps.miva.com/quantity-limits.html) module available in the Miva Apps store. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css` and the JavaScript is in `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.js`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `build/extensions/quantify/` and update as part of your build process.
